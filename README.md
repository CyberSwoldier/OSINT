Professional OSINT & Threat Intelligence Framework

A comprehensive open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering framework designed for security researchers, threat intelligence analysts, incident responders, and investigative journalists. This tool provides law enforcement-grade intelligence capabilities using exclusively public data sources.

Overview
The Professional Intelligence Framework is an advanced OSINT toolkit that correlates information from dozens of public sources to provide comprehensive intelligence reports on digital entities. Built for legitimate security research and investigations, it automates the tedious process of gathering and correlating publicly available information.

Email deliverability and validation analysis
Malicious contact detection and reputation scoring
Associated account discovery across 300+ platforms
Corporate vs. personal email classification

Phone Number Intelligence:

Carrier identification and line type detection (Mobile/Landline/VOIP)
Geographic location mapping with area code resolution
Spam and fraud risk assessment
Social media profile correlation
International number support (US, EU, and global)

Username Intelligence:

Cross-platform presence detection (300+ social networks)
Digital footprint mapping and correlation
Account age estimation and activity patterns
Identity verification and impersonation detection

Domain & Infrastructure Intelligence:

Privacy & Security Considerations
For Investigators:

Use VPN/proxy when conducting sensitive investigations
Maintain operational security protocols
Document all queries for legal compliance
Ensure proper authorization before investigation

For Subjects:

All data collected is publicly available
No private communications are accessed
Information is what exists in public breach databases and social platforms
Users can request reports on themselves to understand their digital exposure

Responsible Disclosure
If you discover vulnerabilities or ethical concerns with this framework, please report them responsibly.
